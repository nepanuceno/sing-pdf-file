# basic-docker-project
A simple basic docker infrastructure project for PHP applications.

With this Docker framework, you can run a pure PHP project or even a Laravel project, just take the files from this project to your project, and in case it's Laravel, uncomment the evironment settings if you need to.

Change the name of the services as you wish, add the services you need, enable them, disable the ports you need and get to work.

``` 
docker-compose up -d
```
# sing-pdf-file
